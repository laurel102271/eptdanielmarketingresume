### Milestone 1 Feedback
This is much better, and you're headed in the right direction now. Nice work getting these revisions done. There are a few lines that got blurred in the Goals and User Story, but overall the direction you have outlined here is clear. Your code looks good, and the project is set up correctly - you're ready to begin Milestone 2a. Please get started ASAP so you don't fall behind schedule.

Your Milestone 1 now passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
No need to update anything because it's time to move forward, but I wanted to highlight the following points:
- The last 2 Goals are more relevant to your job search process, and not development of this site.
- The User Story you have here is _your_ user story - it should be written for the Persona.
